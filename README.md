   Project Proposal PCO for Software Technologies for the Web exam
  </h3>
</div>

## 🖥️ Introduction

PCO (Paradise of Computer Objects) is an e-commerce site that aims to sell
computer objects of any (processors, motherboards, video cards, HDDs, etc ...), of any brand and manufacturer, satisfying the tastes of all enthusiasts
of PC hardware, but also of casual users.
For the purpose, we want to create a site with an interface that is not too complex and aesthetically
pleasant for users and that it is responsive, in order to satisfy even users who
connects to the site from devices other than PCs, such as smartphones, tablets, etc.

It was created during the Software Technologies for the Web exam of the University of Salerno.
